HOT Image Pane w/ Caption!
==============

**IMAGE DOESNT SEEM TO LOAD HERE**

This Fancy module will use an image, apply an image style and gives options for different Overlays / Background captions.  Almost everything can be done in this panel.  Very little external CSS will be needed.  Great for when you need a quick image with a caption on it.  

What this module is capable of:
<ol>
<li>apply html classes to the caption in pane, apply colors in pane, apply padding in pane!</li>
<li>Use any image + image style to display</li> 
<li>On the 2 options with left or right solid background caption; the caption is col-md-3 and the image is col-md-9</li>
</ol>

Still working on the overlays right now...


NOTE
===================
You can also put &lt;none&gt; in the title as well.
